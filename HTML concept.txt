Q5  What are attributes in HTML?

Q6 What are data- attributes good for?

     semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes,
     or extra properties on DOM.

Q7 Describe the difference between &<script>, <script async> and <script defer>?
ANS: 1) <script> = used to define a client-side script

    2) <script async≥= If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page
                     (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing) If async is not present and defer is present:
                     The script is executed when the page has finished parsing.

    3) <script defer≥= The defer attribute tells the browser to only execute the script file once the HTML document has been fully parsed.

Q8 Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between <head></head&> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?
ANS: CSS files are linked in the head because they get applied regardless of DOM already rendered or not.
     Hence the webpage looks elegant as soon as the page loads.
     The main reason as to why JS files are linked at the bottom of the body is because whenever a browser encounters any JS,
     it parses it and executes that on the spot. Hence if it was to be added at the top, it would make the page rendering slow and thus
     it would take more time for page load. Moreover since the DOM won't be rendered fully, JS won't be able to manipulate the elements.
